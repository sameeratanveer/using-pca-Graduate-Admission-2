# using-pca-Graduate-Admission-2
In this project, I worked with the Graduate Admission -2 dataset from Kaggle to explore and visualize the data distribution and relationships using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then trained the model using Linear Regression and achieved 82.5% of r2_score without any hyperparameter tuning or complex algorithms.
