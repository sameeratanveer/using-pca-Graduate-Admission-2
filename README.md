# using-pca-Graduate-Admission-2
In this project, I worked with the Graduate Admission -2 dataset from Kaggle to explore and visualize the data distribution and relationships using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then trained the model using Linear Regression and achieved 82.5% of r2_score without any hyperparameter tuning or complex algorithms.

PCA not only helped with dimensionality reduction but also provided valuable insights into the linear relationships within the data.

After gaining an understanding of the data through PCA, I applied a Linear Regression model since the dataset exhibited a clear linear relationship. The model achieved an RÂ² score of 82.5%, without requiring hyperparameter tuning or more complex techniques.

This project enhanced my understanding of:

1. Using PCA for both visualization and dimensionality reduction while preserving key data relationships.
2. Selecting appropriate models based on data analysis and the nature of the dataset.
